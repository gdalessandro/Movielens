NOTES:    * MODIFY THE raw_work_dir VARIABLE IN THE MOVIELENS.R
            FILE TO FIT YOUR  MOVIELENS INSTALLATION DIRECTORY SETTINGS 
            BEFORE RUNNING THE SCRIP (EG, raw_work_dir <- "~movielens",
            FOR EXAMPLE)
            
            * THE CODE ALSO EXPECTS A ./data/rds FOLDER RELATIVE TO
              YOUR MOVILENS WORKING DIRECTORY
              
            * THE sapply() LOOPS TEND TO BE LENGTHLY TO COMPUTE THE
              RMSEs OF THE MOVIE EFFECTS AND USER EFFECTS REEGULARIZED
              METHODS
